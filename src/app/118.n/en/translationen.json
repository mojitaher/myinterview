  "Aboutme": "I am Mojtaba Taherkhani, a front-end developer. I love programming and this makes me want to improve and learn more in this field. The tools I work with are Next.js, React, and TypeScript. I use Tailwind for design and in some cases I use Material UI for ready-made components, but due to the heavy nature of the project, I mostly use Flowbite React.I spent eight months at the Frontline Coding Bootcamp learning things like Racket, Tailwind, and JavaScript, and I have certificates in them. My main goal for this path is to become a full-stack developer and I will do my best to achieve this.",
